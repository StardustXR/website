# Stardust XR Website

This repository contains a minimal static website for the Stardust XR project.

## Usage

No build tools are required. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the
folder with any static web server.

## Documentation

Markdown files live in the `docs/` directory. The docs page loads them on demand
using the [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) library. To link to a document, use a
URL of the form:

```
/docs/#path/to/file
```

Adding a new document is as easy as dropping a `.md` file into the `docs`
folder.
