# What is Stardust XR?  
[![Stardust XR Demo Reel](/img/docs/sizzlethumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2WblwbaLaA)

Stardust XR is an XR [display server](https://itsfoss.com/display-server/) for Linux-based systems. It is functionally however, much more like a 3D environment, with applications ranging from simple 2D floating windows of your normal Linux programs, up to 3D applications that wouldn't otherwise be feasable outside of an XR environment. The design philosophy behind Stardust is what truly sets it apart, with user interface functions that not only work exclusively in an XR environment, but ones that push the user to understand the underlying connections in a way that can't be replicated with a keyboard and mouse. 

Though Stardust XR isn't an operating system, because the different clients are all treated as independent objects, it is a truly unique experience to be able to place applications, both 2D and 3D, wherever you want in the area you are working in, whether that's at your desktop or an entire room 

If you'd like to quickly try out Stardust XR on your desktop without the need to setup a headset, head to the [Quick Start](Quickstart) guide. If you need to set up your VR headset within Linux, let's [Setup OpenXR Runtime](setup-openxr). If you already have your heatset setup, head to the [Full Stardust Installation](manual) page. If you've never used Linux before (or even if you have), and you have a Meta Quest device, we've created a [full walkthrough to get you started playing with Stardust](quest-3-setup)!

Stardust XR is acitvely looking for help with development to expand the project. You can also [become a sponsor.](https://github.com/sponsors/technobaboo).
