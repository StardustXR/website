[![Stardust XR Demo Reel](/img/docs/sizzlethumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2WblwbaLaA)

Stardust XR is a [display server](https://itsfoss.com/display-server/) for VR and AR headsets on Linux-based systems. Stardust provides a 3D environment, where anything from 2D windows (including your existing apps!), to 3D apps built from objects, can exist together in physical space. 


If you'd like to try Stardust XR on your existing device without a headset, head to the [Quick Start](Quickstart) guide. If you'd like to use a VR headset, check out [Set up OpenXR Runtime](setup-openxr). If you already have your headset set up, head to the [Full Stardust Installation](manual) page. If you've a beginner, and have a Meta Quest device, we've created a [full walkthrough to get you started playing with Stardust](quest-3-setup)!

Stardust XR is acitvely looking for help with development to expand the project. You can also [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/technobaboo).
