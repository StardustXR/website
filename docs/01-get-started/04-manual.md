If you already added Terra when setting up the Open XR runtime, you can skip to the install commands below.

:::info
Stardust XR is packaged in the [Terra repository](https://terra.fyralabs.com/). If you are using [Ultramarine Linux](https://ultramarine-linux.org), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), or [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev), this repository comes pre-installed, otherwise you will need to add the repository:

Standard Fedora Editions and derivatives can directly install terra-release:
```
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

If you are using [RHEL10](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux-10) or derrivative you will need to first the EPEL repos, which may be installed with:
```
sudo dnf install 'https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-$releasever.noarch.rpm'
```

Then install terra-release:

```
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

If you are using a [Fedora Atomic Edition](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) or derrivative you will need to run the following command:
```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```
:::  
Then, run this command to install all Stardust XR packages:
```
sudo dnf group install stardust-xr
```

If using a Fedora Atomic/Universal Blue based image, run the following command to install all Stardust XR packages:

```
sudo rpm-ostree install stardust-xr-armillary stardust-xr-atmosphere stardust-xr-black-hole stardust-xr-comet stardust-xr-flatland stardust-xr-gravity stardust-xr-magnetar stardust-xr-non-spatial-input stardust-xr-protostar stardust-xr-server stardust-xr-telescope
```
<h3>
  <img src="/img/docs/arch.png" alt="Logo" style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '1em', marginRight: '0.5em' }} />
  Arch Linux 
</h3>

```
paru -s stardust-xr-armillary stardust-xr-atmosphere stardust-xr-black-hole stardust-xr-comet stardust-xr-flatland stardust-xr-gravity stardust-xr-magnetar stardust-xr-non-spatial-input stardust-xr-protostar stardust-xr-server stardust-xr-telescope
```

On NixOS, use the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux). Make sure [flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes).
```
nix run github:StardustXR/telescope
```

From there, you can launch Stardust with `telescope`, then in another terminal window or tab, run any other clients you need. We recommend `flatland` and `hexagon-launcher`.

# Manual Build  
:::caution  
Make sure all of the repositories that are cloned are on the same branch (e.g. all main or all dev branch) to ensure Stardust protocol compatibility  
:::
### Server

Clone the [Stardust XR Server](https://github.com/StardustXR/server) `https://github.com/StardustXR/server`

Make sure to check the list of prerequisites. Run `cargo build` and `cargo run` in the cloned repo to start the server. As stated above, the Stardust server will simply load in with a black void until clients are loaded in. This behaviour can currently be modified by creating a `startup` file inside the folder `~/.config/stardust/` to automate the loading in of clients, an example of which is shown [here](https://youtu.be/c6RyEYDz2iw?si=pL1zffNVsWocZHrc&t=788), and an example of is linked [here](https://github.com/cyberneticmelon/usefulscripts/blob/main/startup)

### Clients

After the server is running, you'll need to run some clients. Clone any of these, `cargo build` & then `cargo run` after the server is already running, and they will load into the Stardust server!  

Non-exhaustive list of clients:
- [**armillary**](https://github.com/StardustXR/Armillary): `https://github.com/StardustXR/Armillary`  
A 3D model viewer for Stardust XR; rotate, move, and display models in your XR space
- [**atmosphere**](https://github.com/StardustXR/atmosphere): `https://github.com/StardustXR/atmosphere`  
3D environment with natural momentum-based movement
- [**black hole**](https://github.com/StardustXR/black-hole): `https://github.com/StardustXR/black-hole`  
Universal minimization of Stardust objects
- [**comet**](https://github.com/StardustXR/comet): `https://github.com/StardustXR/comet`  
Write in 3D wherever you want amongst your other apps!
- [**flatland**](https://github.com/StardustXR/flatland): `https://github.com/StardustXR/flatland`  
3D panel UI (like window manager) for interacting with all your 2D apps
- [**gravity**](https://github.com/StardustXR/gravity): `https://github.com/StardustXR/gravity`  
Launch programs with a certain offset in 3D space
- [**magnetar**](https://github.com/StardustXR/magnetar): `https://github.com/StardustXR/magnetar`  
Example workspaces client
- [**non-spatial-input**](https://github.com/StardustXR/non-spatial-input): `https://github.com/StardustXR/non-spatial-input`  
Provides utilities to port keyboard, mouse, and other input methods like libinput into Stardust XR
- [**protostar**](https://github.com/StardustXR/protostar): `https://github.com/StardustXR/protostar`  
App launcher library and examples including futuristic Hexagon Launcher

### Installation Script

If you have all the correct dependencies, we've created a [script](https://github.com/cyberneticmelon/usefulscripts/blob/main/stardustxr_setup.sh) that will automatically `git clone` all of the necessary repositories, `cargo build` all of them, and give them a symlinks for running the server and clients from the command line. It also creates a [config](https://github.com/cyberneticmelon/usefulscripts/blob/main/startup) file that will by default install the default `atmosphere` background. Run the script with flag `-nobg` if you don't want that.

# After Installation

You can either use [Telescope](Quickstart) to launch the Stardust XR server and a small selection of clients (`telescope` in your terminal, or `telescope -f` for flatscreen mode), or you can run the server directly, which only provides a void by default, as there are no applications or clients within it. You can then launch any combination of the clients (listed above), as they are all considered separate items but can run concurrently inside Stardust.

You will see a floating hexagon with the Stardust XR logo in the center, this is Hexagon Launcher.
To move around, hold down ***Shift*** and ***W A S D***, with ***Q*** for moving down and ***E*** for moving up.  
![WASD Q E Look around](/img/updated_flat_wasd.GIF)

To look around, hold down ***Shift*** and ***Right Click*** while moving the mouse.  
![Look around](/img/updated_flat_look.GIF)

If you click on the hexagon, the launcher will open. Try dragging one of the apps with `Shift + ~`. The small minus sign is Black Hole, if you click it, it will grab any open window and store it away. Click it again and they will return to their original location.

If you are already using OpenXR within Linux, running `telescope` while OpenXR is running should launch Stardust on your headset. If not, check further instructions for setting up OpenXR.
