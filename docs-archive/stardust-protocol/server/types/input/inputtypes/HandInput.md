# HandInput

### Derived from [InputMethod](../InputMethod)

A full 27-bone hand+forearm input with useful abstractions provided through the datamap.

The local space of a hand is where +Z is away from the palm, +Y is from the palm to the fingers, and +X is orthogonal and to the right.

## Serialization

| Key       | Value Type   |
|-----------|--------------|
| origin    | `Vector3`    |
| direction | `Vector3`    |
| tilt      | `float`      |
| datamap   | `Dictionary` |

## Datamap

### Required

| Key             | Value Type                  | Description                                                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| confidence      | `float` (range `0.0`-`1.0`) | How confident the hand tracker is of the pose of the hand          |
| isLeft   | `bool` | `true` if this hand is the left hand, `false` if not |
| pinchStrength   | `float` (range `0.0`-`1.0`) | How much the hand is pinching                                      |
| pinchDistance   | `float` (>`0.0`)            | The distance in meters between the thumb and index finger |
| grabStrength    | `float` (range `0.0`-`1.0`) | How much the hand is making a fist                                 |
